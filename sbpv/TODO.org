** Nominal Data Types  

   For minimalism purposes, the best primitive for a new vtype to add
   are
   
   `new-vtype : UF(U(? -> F ?) x U(∀ Y. U(? -> Y) -> UY -> ? -> Y))`
   
   which returns a pair of
   1. An injection function that takes a value and wraps it in the
      constructor of this type
   2. A pattern-matching function that takes a continuation for the
      unwrapped value and an else case and an arg to pattern match on
      for the newly generated type.

   Similarly, a minimalist primitive for a new ctype is to add

   `new-ctype : UF(U(U¿ -> ¿) x U(U¿ -> U¿ -> ¿))`

   which returns a pair of
   1. A projection function that takes a thunk and calls it with the
      new method of this type
   2. A copattern-matching function that takes a continuation for if
      the method for this type is at the top of the stack, and another
      continuation for if the method does not match.

   A more user-friendly version might include an *arity* for the
   constructor/destructor in each case. The above examples are arity
   1, and are enough to implement the rest in the presence of x and
   ->. using dependency:

   new-vtype* : U((n : Nat) -> F(U(? ->^n F ?) x ∀ Y. U(? ->^n Y) -> UY -> ? -> Y))

   new-ctype* : U((n : Nat)-> F(U(U¿ -> ? ->^n ¿) x U(U(? ->^n ¿) -> U¿ -> ¿)))
